# Very Very Basic SQL Reports for koha

## Outside resources

https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp
http://schema.koha-community.org/


## Koha reports only allows "SELECT" SQL

You can only run SELECT statements.  If you include any of these SQL commands, you'll get an error message:

UPDATE
DELETE
DROP
INSERT
SHOW
CREATE


If you need to run SQL that requires any of these commands, you need to have direct access to your database and you need to really know what you're doing.
